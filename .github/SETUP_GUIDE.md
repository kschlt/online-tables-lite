# AI-Era Protection Setup Guide

## 🛡️ GitHub Branch Protection (Required)

### Step 1: Enable Branch Protection
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Status checks: `Quality Checks`
   - ✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings

3. Add rule for `production` branch:
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Status checks: `Quality Checks`
   - ✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings

## 🚀 Your Simplified Workflow

### Development
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-change

# 2. Make changes (AI can help here)
# ... your development work ...

# 3. Commit changes
git commit -m "your changes"
```

### Merge to Main
```bash
# 4. Merge to main (local merge allowed)
git checkout main
git merge feature/your-change

# 5. Push main (triggers CI checks)
git push origin main
```

### Deploy to Production
```bash
# 6. Merge to production
git checkout production
git merge main

# 7. Push production (triggers pre-push checks)
git push origin production

# 8. Deploy manually via GitHub Actions
# Go to Actions → Deploy → Run workflow
```

## 🎯 What's Protected

### ✅ AI-Friendly Features
- ✅ AI can work in feature branches freely
- ✅ AI can help with code changes
- ✅ AI can commit to feature branches
- ✅ Local merges are allowed

### 🛡️ AI Protection
- ��️ AI cannot commit directly to main
- 🛡️ AI cannot commit directly to production
- 🛡️ Production pushes are validated
- 🛡️ Broken code cannot reach production

## 🔧 Manual Deployment

### Deploy via GitHub Actions
1. Go to GitHub → Actions → "Deploy"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select environment (production/preview)
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Monitor deployment progress

## 📊 Complexity Comparison
